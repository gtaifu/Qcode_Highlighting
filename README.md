# qasm_highlighting
Sublime Text 3 package for QASM and QuMIS syntax highlighting.

## Installation
Download the  ```qasm.sublime-syntax``` and ```qumis.sublime-syntax``` files and put them in the following folder: 
* ```%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\``` on Windows OS.
* ```/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User``` on Mac OS (maybe also applicable to Linux).

The code highlighting can work with the Sublime Text default theme. But it works best with the **Monokai** color scheme.

### Installation tips: 
* In Windows, you could directly copy and paste the address in the windows explorer address bar, then Windows explorer will automatically reslove %APPDATA% macro and show the required folder.
