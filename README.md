# qasm_highlighting
Sublime Text 3 package for eQASM, QASM and QuMIS syntax highlighting.

## Installation
### Automatic installation (recommended)
Use package control and install `qasm_highlighting`.

### Manual Installation
Download the files ```<eqasm/qasm/qumis>.sublime-syntax``` and put them in the following folder:
* ```%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\``` on Windows OS.
* ```/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User``` on Mac OS (maybe also applicable to Linux).

The code highlighting can work with the Sublime Text default theme. But it works best with the **Monokai** color scheme.

#### Installation tips:
* In Windows, you could directly copy and paste the address in the windows explorer address bar, then Windows explorer will automatically reslove %APPDATA% macro and show the required folder.
